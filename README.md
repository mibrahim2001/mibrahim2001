ðŸ”¥ Hey, I'm Ibrahim! I'm a front-end developer with a love for React, competitive programming, and all things ML and AI.

ðŸ’» Constantly learning and growing my skills, I specialize in ReactJS and React Native. In my free time, you can find me diving into the latest ML and AI technologies   and trying out new projects.

ðŸ’ª When I'm not busy coding or learning, you can find me tackling new challenges and finding creative solutions to problems.

ðŸ¤“ I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Let's chat if you have a project that could use a little extra magic (or someone to dominate the next coding competition with).

ðŸ“§ You can reach me at mibrahim37612@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-reactnative-developer/) .

ðŸš€ Thanks for stopping by! I can't wait to see what we can build (and conquer) together.
