🔥 Hey, I'm Ibrahim! I'm a front-end developer with a love for React, competitive programming, and all things ML and AI.

💻 Constantly learning and growing my skills, I specialize in ReactJS and React Native. In my free time, you can find me diving into the latest ML and AI technologies   and trying out new projects.

💪 When I'm not busy coding or learning, you can find me tackling new challenges and finding creative solutions to problems.

🤓 I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Let's chat if you have a project that could use a little extra magic (or someone to dominate the next coding competition with).

📧 You can reach me at mibrahim37612@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-reactnative-developer/) .

🚀 Thanks for stopping by! I can't wait to see what we can build (and conquer) together.
